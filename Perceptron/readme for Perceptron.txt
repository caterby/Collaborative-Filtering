1. put the *java file under the same file of dataset file;

2. find the path of the *java file under the cmd;

3. using javac Perceptron.java command to execute the java file;

4. after the third step, it will make some .class files, then use the command: java Perceptron
   to execute the .class files, then we can get the result.

Several results of the algorithm are below:

****************THE RESULT WITH STOP WORDS***************

learningRate = 0.004, iteration = 60 The accuracy is: 0.893305439330544

learningRate = 0.006, iteration = 59 The accuracy is: 0.893305439330544

learningRate = 0.008, iteration = 58 The accuracy is: 0.893305439330544

learningRate = 0.01, iteration = 57 The accuracy is: 0.895397489539749

learningRate = 0.012, iteration = 56 The accuracy is: 0.893305439330544

learningRate = 0.014, iteration = 55 The accuracy is: 0.899581589958159


***************THE RESULT WITHOUT STOP WORDS**************

learningRate = 0.004, iteration = 60 The accuracy is: 0.899581589958159

learningRate = 0.006, iteration = 59 The accuracy is: 0.897489539748954

learningRate = 0.008, iteration = 58 The accuracy is: 0.899581589958159

learningRate = 0.01, iteration = 57 The accuracy is: 0.899581589958159

learningRate = 0.012, iteration = 56 The accuracy is: 0.897489539748954

learningRate = 0.014, iteration = 55 The accuracy is: 0.895397489539749


Conclussion:

Change the learning rate and the number of the iterations,
at last, the accuracy of the Perceptron can be around 93%
